# Hey, I'm Shaquille 🚀

Welcome to my little playground on the internet.  

## What you’ll find here:
- 🤖 Bots doing things that I don’t want to do
- 📈 Trading tools that *may or may not* predict the future  
- 🌍 Web apps that try to make life a little smoother
- 🧰 Sandbox projects to explore different technologies
- 🏡 Real estate side-quests (because why not?)  

Some projects are polished, others are rough sketches, but all of them tell a story of what I’m exploring and where I’m going.

**Current Quest:** Building systems that bring humans and technology into better alignment.
